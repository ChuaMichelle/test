		When most people think of the Netherlands, they think of Amsterdam with its famous red lights and coffeeshops. And maybe tulips, too. 
		<br />
		But there is much more to the country than those three things. The Netherlands is a country filled with historic cities, canals, beautiful farm land, windmills, and pleasant beaches.
		<br />Most travelers come to the Netherlands and only party in Amsterdam for a few days, but by doing so, they miss much of what the country has to offer. Spend time exploring Holland <br />and you’ll discover the country that keeps me coming back every year. I highly recommend heading north (especially in April or May when the tulips are in bloom) and also visiting Utrecht, <br />one of my favorite cities south of Amsterdam.

		<p><strong>Visit Amsterdam</strong> – The capital and center of tourism in Holland, Amsterdam is as beautiful and serene as it is crazy. There’s lovely canals, beautiful houses, great shops, food, and, of course, the infamous red light district.
			Take a canal tour – Whether in Amsterdam or in another city, make sure you take a canal tour and see the canals that made the area famous and inhabitable. The Dutch practically perfected canal-building and it’s such an integral part of life here, that you can’t really understand the country until you spend time boating on the canals.
